## Installation
Run inside *web-app* directory:
- `npm install` : performs the installation of packages needed for the front-end operation.

Run inside db directory:
- `npm install` : performs the installation of packages needed for the database operation.


## Scripts
Run inside web-app directory:
- `npm start` : runs the app in the development mode. Use [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in the browser. Makes available features like automatic reloading after edits and lint errors in the console.
- `npm test` : Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build` : Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. Correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance. App is ready to be deployed.
- `npm run eject` : If the build tool and configuration choices doesn't satisfy you, you can `eject`at any time. This scrip will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own. **Note:** this is a one-way operation. **Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

Run inside db directory:
- `npm run client` : starts the server services by executing *server.js*.
- `npm run dev` : runs the front-end in the development mode by running `npm start` in the **web-app** directory and also runs `npm start` for the **db** directory. This makes available the full development mode for this application.
